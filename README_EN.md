# Lora tips Word writing tips

<lora:xxxx:0.3:0.4> This formulation explains that 0.3 is the model strength and 0.4 is the CLIP strength
If you are <lora:xxxx:0.4> then this interpretation of the model strength and CLIP strength are both 0.4

# Summary

This project allows you to write Prompt words in ComfyUI like WebUI, modified from the prompt-all-in-one project, but has made most of the changes to adapt to ComfyUI, adding many different functions, as well as the plugin for prompt word completion. The prompt word completion plugin is modified from the ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts project. Thank you for your support of this plugin.

# WeiLin-ComfyUI-Prompt-all-in-one Reference project

WeiLin-ComfyUI-Prompt-all-in-one The ComfyUI version of prompt-all-in-one, a ComfyUI version modified based on the SD-wewe-prompt-all-in-one-app https://github.com/Physton/sd-webui-prompt-all-in-one-app project, Just add the ComfyUI node of the project to ComfyUI to use the visual tag editor. Cue word completion using the https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts project changes only the function of the completion and make the changes, Projects using local LLM big model borrowed from https://github.com/thisjam/comfyui-sixgod_prompt warehouse code

# A brief description of this item

At the beginning, the project was just convenient for editing the tag, so I wrote my own plugin, and if you have any questions, you can submit an issue, which may not necessarily be dealt with.
